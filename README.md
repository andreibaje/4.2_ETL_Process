# 4.2 ETL Process

## The Project
The **ETL Process** project from **Chapter 4: Data Management and Storage with Python** is meant to introduce the usage of Pandas, Dataframe, and ETL Pipelines in the Python Programming World. In this particular assignment, there was given a CSV file `movies.csv. The content of the file containing the statistics about a bunch of popular movie titles. The main task implied the creation of 4 different excel files, having the top 10 highest grossing movies of 4 selected countries from the list and sorted accordingly to their profit. 

## Documents
**`movies.csv`** represents the main file containing all the titles which will later be sorted and selected.
**`main.py`** manages the whole process and contains the code running this process.
**`personal_test_results`** is the folder with the template answers that should be given once the `main.py`code is running.
**`link.txt`** just contains the link redirecting to the official github repository
